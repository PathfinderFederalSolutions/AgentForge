# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documents and scripts that were moved from the root directory during the project cleanup and organization phase.

## Contents

### Consolidation Reports (`consolidation-reports/`)
Historical reports from the system consolidation and integration phases:
- `CONSOLIDATION_SUCCESS_REPORT.md` - Initial orchestrator consolidation report
- `FINAL_CONSOLIDATION_REPORT.md` - Final system consolidation documentation
- `ORCHESTRATOR_CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE.md` - Orchestrator-specific consolidation details

### Migration Guides (`migration-guides/`)
Documentation for system migrations and architectural changes:
- `UNIFIED_ORCHESTRATOR_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Guide for orchestrator system migration

### Verification Scripts (`verification-scripts/`)
Scripts used to verify system functionality during development:
- `verify_real_introspection.py` - AGI introspection verification script
- `verify_unified_orchestrator.py` - Orchestrator functionality verification

## Purpose

These files were moved to the archive to:
1. **Clean up the root directory** - Remove outdated documentation from the main project space
2. **Preserve history** - Maintain historical context and development progression
3. **Improve navigation** - Make the current project structure clearer for new developers
4. **Maintain references** - Keep verification scripts and migration guides accessible for reference

## Usage

These archived files are primarily for:
- **Historical reference** - Understanding the development and consolidation process
- **Debugging** - Using verification scripts to test system components
- **Migration assistance** - Referencing migration guides for future system changes
- **Documentation** - Understanding architectural decisions and changes made during development

## Note for Developers

While these files are archived, they may still contain useful information for:
- Understanding system architecture evolution
- Debugging complex integration issues
- Planning future system migrations
- Verifying system functionality during development

The verification scripts in particular may be useful for testing system components during development and debugging.
