## 🎯 What You'll Get

**Upload medical files → Ask for VA ratings →**

```
Based on analysis of your medical records by 3 specialized agents, I identified 9 VA-ratable conditions:

**1. Sleep Apnea**
   • Estimated VA Rating: **50%**
   • Evidence: "Patient diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea requiring continuous positive airway pressure therapy"
   • Sources: Sleep Study.pdf, NOVA Pulmonary.pdf, AWP.pdf
   • Analysis Confidence: 90%

**2. Tinnitus (Bilateral)**
   • Estimated VA Rating: **10%**
   • Evidence: "Bilateral tinnitus documented with persistent ringing in both ears affecting hearing and daily activities"
   • Sources: Doctors Visit.pdf, AWP.pdf
   • Analysis Confidence: 92%

**3. Chronic Back Pain**
   • Estimated VA Rating: **20-40%**
   • Evidence: "Chronic lumbar pain documented with limited range of motion and ongoing pain management treatment required"
   • Sources: Doctors Visit.pdf, Primary Care.pdf, Medical Report.pdf
   • Analysis Confidence: 88%

[... all conditions with CLEAN evidence ...]

**Next Steps:**
• File VA claims for all 9 identified conditions
• Gather additional medical evidence where needed
• Obtain nexus letters linking conditions to military service

*Analysis completed by 3 specialized agents analyzing 18 medical documents. 
Processing time: 31.1s. Overall confidence: 88%*
