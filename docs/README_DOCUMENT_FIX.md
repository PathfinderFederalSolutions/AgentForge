# 📄 Document Extraction Fix - README

## TL;DR

Your system now **actually reads file content** instead of just seeing filenames.

## The 2-Minute Fix

```bash
cd /Users/baileymahoney/AgentForge

# Step 1: Install libraries (30 seconds)
./install_document_processing.sh

# Step 2: Restart (30 seconds)  
./restart_clean.sh

# Step 3: Use it!
# - Go to http://localhost:3002
# - Re-upload your 23 medical records
# - Ask your VA rating question
# - Get REAL analysis this time!
```

## What Changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Saves "file.pdf" | ✅ Extracts "Full medical record text..." |
| ❌ AI sees filename only | ✅ AI sees actual content |
| ❌ Generic responses | ✅ Data-driven analysis |

## Quick Test

After restart, upload a PDF and watch terminal:
```
✅ Document Extractor loaded              ← Good!
✅ Included extracted content from...     ← Working!
```
