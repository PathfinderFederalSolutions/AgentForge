### Example Output
```
Based on analysis of your 23 medical documents by 7 specialized agents, 
I identified 9 VA-ratable conditions:

**1. Sleep Apnea**
   • Estimated VA Rating: **50%**
   • Evidence: "Patient diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea requiring CPAP therapy"
   • Sources: Sleep Study.pdf, NOVA Pulmonary.pdf
   • Analysis Confidence: 90%

[... all conditions with clean evidence ...]

**Next Steps:**
• File VA claims for all 9 conditions
• Gather additional medical evidence
• Obtain nexus letters

*Analysis by 7 agents in 31.2s. Confidence: 88%*
```

## 📋 KNOWN LIMITATIONS & WORKAROUNDS

**Limitation**: Web UI upload limited to ~50 files per upload

**Workarounds**:
1. **Multiple uploads** - Upload in batches of 30-40 files
2. **CLI tool** - `upload_cli.py` for massive datasets
3. **Focus** - Most use cases <50 files anyway!

**Not a Problem For**:
- ✅ Medical VA analysis (typically 10-30 files)
- ✅ M&A due diligence (typically 20-50 files)
- ✅ Legal contract review (typically 5-20 files)
- ✅ 99% of real-world use cases
